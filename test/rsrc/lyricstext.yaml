Amsterdam: |
    Dans le port d'Amsterdam
    Y a des marins qui chantent
    Les rêves qui les hantent
    Au large d'Amsterdam
    Dans le port d'Amsterdam
    Y a des marins qui dorment
    Comme des oriflammes
    Le long des berges mornes
    Dans le port d'Amsterdam
    Y a des marins qui meurent
    Pleins de bière et de drames
    Aux premières lueurs
    Mais dans le port d'Amsterdam
    Y a des marins qui naissent
    Dans la chaleur épaisse
    Des langueurs océanes
    Dans le port d'Amsterdam
    Y a des marins qui mangent
    Sur des nappes trop blanches
    Des poissons ruisselants
    Ils vous montrent des dents
    A croquer la fortune
    A décroisser la lune
    A bouffer des haubans
    Et ça sent la morue
    Jusque dans le coeur des frites
    Que leurs grosses mains invitent
    A revenir en plus
    Puis se lèvent en riant
    Dans un bruit de tempête
    Referment leur braguette
    Et sortent en rotant
    Dans le port d'Amsterdam
    Y a des marins qui dansent
    En se frottant la panse
    Sur la panse des femmes
    Et ils tournent et ils dansent
    Comme des soleils crachés
    Dans le son déchiré
    D'un accordéon rance
    Ils se tordent le cou
    Pour mieux s'entendre rire
    Jusqu'à ce que tout à coup
    L'accordéon expire
    Alors le geste grave
    Alors le regard fier
    Ils ramènent leur batave
    Jusqu'en pleine lumière
    Dans le port d'Amsterdam
    Y a des marins qui boivent
    Et qui boivent et reboivent
    Et qui reboivent encore
    Ils boivent à la santé
    Des putains d'Amsterdam
    De Hambourg ou d'ailleurs
    Enfin ils boivent aux dames
    Qui leur donnent leur joli corps
    Qui leur donnent leur vertu
    Pour une pièce en or
    Et quand ils ont bien bu
    Se plantent le nez au ciel
    Se mouchent dans les étoiles
    Et ils pissent comme je pleure
    Sur les femmes infidèles
    Dans le port d'Amsterdam

Lady_Madonna: |
    Lady Madonna, children at your feet
    Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
    Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?
    Did you think that money was Heaven sent?
    Friday night arrives without a suitcase
    Sunday morning creep in like a nun
    Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
    See how they run

    Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
    Wonder how you manage to feed the rest

    See how they run

    Lady Madonna, lying on the bed
    Listen to the music playing in your head

    Tuesday afternoon is never ending
    Wednesday morning papers didn't come
    Thursday night you stockings needed mending
    See how they run

    Lady Madonna, children at your feet
    Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

    It's always gone within two days.
    Follow my father, his extravagant ways.
    So if I got it I will spend it all,
    Camden and Parkway 'til I hit a wall.

    I cross my fingers at the cash machine,
    As I check my balance I kiss the screen.
    I love it when it says I got the means,
    To go to Miss Sixty and pick up my new jeans.

    Chorus: (x2)
    Never lasts me long,
    Handle finance wrong,
    Blow it all on bags and shoes,
    Jazz 'n blues.

    Standin' too deep at the bar today,
    Wait with impatience to throw my cash away.
    Four white Russians a JD and Coke,
    Buy their drinks all night and now I am broke.
    But that's cool 'cause I can borrow more from you,
    And I didn't forget about that fifty pound, too.
    Tell you what, my advance is comin' through,
    I'll take you out shoppin',
    Can you wait 'til next June? Yeah.

    Chorus:
    Never lasts me long,
    Handle finance wrong (handle it wrong),
    Blow it all on bags and shoes,
    Jazz 'n blues (jazz and blues).
    Never lasts me long (long),
    Handle finance wrong (wrong),
    Blow it all on bags and shoes (blow it all),
    Jazz 'n blues.

I_could_beat_myself: |
    oooh ahh, I'm hurting, bad
    oooh ahh I'm hurting bad!

    I did not see what I was supposed to see
    taking it easy when a friend told me I was in
    danger, so much danger.
    Underestimating my woman, not taking her
    out, working too hard and now she's gone off
    with a stranger, someone I don't even know.

    I should have taken her out, every once and a
    while, taken her to dinner on the finer side, shown
    her a life that was all worth while, now I guese I gotta
    walk an extra mile! I could beat myself! Ahh yeah.

    Now I'm gonna feel funny out there in the crowd
    when my friends all ask me, where is your woman?
    long time I don't see. Now I've got to think fast gotta
    use my head, give a good story and make sure they
    buy my version of the situation.

    All the while I wouldn't lie I'm gonna do this once
    see my reputation sinking in the distance, if they
    knew the truth that really existed...then my little sanity
    would be wasted! I could beat myself ahh yes..I could
    beat myself!!! Ohh lord lord.

    oooh ooh I'm hurting, hurting inside
    oooh ooh I'm hurting

    Now I really want to hear a little news now and
    then, this is not what I expect to hear from my
    friend I'm dissapointed. He should realize that its
    gonna destroy my position (remember I'm a name
    brand) now I've gotta see....I should have held her tight
    every once and a while, gotten it together on the finer style
    shown her a life that was all worth while, now it seems I gotta
    walk an extra mile....I could beat myself..ahh yes, I could beat myself
    ooh lord

    ooh I'm hurting
    ooooh I'm hurting,hurting inside

    I don't know what I wanna tell you
    but I wanna tell you something real, real good yes
    someting to make you
    wanna shiver

Hey_it_s_ok: |

    Hey It's OK, It's OK
    Cause I've found what i wanted
    Hey It's OK, I'ts Ok
    Cause I've found what i wanted

    Friends and lovers please forgive
    the mean things I've said
    I swear not to do again
    Please forgive the way I act when
    I've had too much to drink
    I'm fighting against myself

    Hey It's OK, It's OK
    Cause I've found what i wanted
    Hey It's OK, I'ts Ok

    Cause I've found what i wanted

    And I swear not to do anything funny anymore
    yes I swear not to do anything funny anymore

    Hey It's OK, It's OK
    Cause I've found what i wanted
    Hey It's OK, I'ts Ok

City_of_dreams: |
    Day breaks over the city of my childhood
    Daybreak over the city I called home
    Where the sage met the sea and the groves were sweet and green
    It's a city that lives only in my dreams

    The groves where we played when we were children
    The groves where we fooled around as teens
    Those green groves are paved from la to santa fe
    That city lives only in my dreams

    Landmarks lost to parking lots in the city I called home
    Looking back I see what used to be
    Now freeways crawl though the suburban sprawl
    As far as the eye can see
    And the city lives only in my dreams

    Twilight shades the valley of my memory
    When citrus groves still perfumed the sky
    But I guess those orange blossoms weren't so special after all
    Now it's a city of days gone by

    Landmarks lost to parking lots in the city I called home
    Looking back I see what used to be
    Now freeways crawl through the suburban sprawl
    As far as the eye can see
    And the city lives only in my dreams
